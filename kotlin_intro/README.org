#+TITLE: Kotlin Language Exploration

* About:
- Here, I stored all exploration/experimentation related to learning the kotlin language.
- Through this project, I'm also trying to learn Makefile (as a build system).
- Instead of learning ~gradle~, I wants to learn ~Gnu Make~. Because, it's simple, efficient & easy to understand.
- More than that, I would like to learn things that are *timeless* and *invaluable*.


* build
- Just use: ~make run~
- That's it. It will by default compile and run *main.kt*.
- You can change it to compile any other file, just by modifying *Makefile*, or you can specify like ~make run FILE=<newfile_name> CLASS=<newClass_name>~
